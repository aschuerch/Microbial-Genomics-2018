## Pangenome analysis

The microbial **pangenome** is the union of genes shared by genomes of interest. The **core genome** is the intersection of genes of these genomes, thus **core genes** are genes present in all strains. The **accessory genome** (also: variable, flexible, dispensable genome) refers to genes not present in all strains of a species. These include genes present in two or more strains or even genes unique to a single strain. Acquired antibiotic resistance genes are typically genes of the accessory genome.

### Extract genes recX, pblB and dnaA from two genomes.

For this, we need to find if the genes are present in the annotated files.

Note for each genome if the gene has been found or not. Mark them as present (1) in this [file]( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1b8BPKcSUuW2YzgHdMaJN3MEbdgroRJa1dWnf5gkHr9M/edit#gid=0 ), else mark the gene that differs or is absent as 0.


## Pangenome analysis

Comparing every gene of every genome to every other gene in the dataset is an enourmous task, and takes a long time even if automated. [Roary](https://sanger-pathogens.github.io/Roary/) is a pipeline to determine genes of the core and pangenome. It takes a few short-cuts such as clustering instead of pair-wise alignment and can perform this task in a relatively short time frame. An excellent step-by-step tutorial can be found [here](https://github.com/microgenomics/tutorials/blob/master/pangenome.md)

First we need to find the files generated by prokka. We are using the annotations prepared beforehand for all genomes. How many are there?

~~~
$ ls ~student100/annotations/*.gff
~~~
{: .source}

then we can go to the orthology directory and start roary. the -p 1 option tells Roary to use two CPU cores, the -s option tells it to disregard genetic context, as we are looking at draft assemblies with different contigs, the -r option generates some interesting plots in R. The 1> and 2> redirect the standard screen output and the error output to a file for later viewing. The -f option tells it where to store the output files (the folder orthology). Roary needs quite some CPU power. 

~~~
$ cd ~
$ roary ~student100/annotations/*.gff -s -p 2 -r -f orthology >roary.stdout.log 2> roary.error.log
~~~
{: .bash}

> ## Discussion: Open or closed pangenome?
> After roary finishes, have a look at the summary file. How many core and pangenome genes are there? Visit the
> definition of an open and closed pangenome [here](http://www.metagenomics.wiki/pdf/definition/pangenome). 
> Does *S. pneumoniae* have a closed or an open pangenome? View the file Rplots.pdf or the file conserved_vs_total_genes.png in your browser to have a different visualization of the core and pan genome.

## Visualization

Some genes are present in all genomes, some are present in some and absent in others. Data on presence and absence of genes was collected in a matrix called gene_presence_absence.csv. Clustering of this information was used to build a tree (available as accessory_binary_genes.fa.newick). As a next step we are going to visualize this clustering.


> ## Challenge: Which isolate(s) is/are related to our reference genome OXC141 based on gene presence/absence??

> Copy accessory_binary_genes.fa.newick and gene_presence_absence.csv to your own computer. 
> Open [phandango](http://jameshadfield.github.io/phandango/) in Chrome, drop file accessory_binary_genes.fa.newick and
